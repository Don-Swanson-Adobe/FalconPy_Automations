# FalconPy_Automations  
Here you'll find samples of automations and scripts we've built to better our workflows and processes at Adobe.  
The samples in the FalconPy Directory have all been fully integrated into the FalconPy Samples [https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy]  
The Samples in the AutomationLambdas Directory are the building blocks for the automations that we've built out in AWS Lambdas  
You'll also find an `example_auth.py` file here that is the framework to be able to store your list of CIDs and credentials for use in the automations. This isn't necessarily the best way to store your credentials, but it's a quick and easy way to get you up and running until you port the samples over to utilize your preferred secrets manager. (The AutomationLambdas Make use of AWS Secrets)
